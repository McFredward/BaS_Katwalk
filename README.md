# BaS_Katwalk
A KatWalk SDK integration mod into Blade&Sorcery **for U12**

## Features:


* Uses official KatWalk SDK
* Better speed integration based on the real-life speed on the KatWalk
* Modifikations with the in-game mod menu for personal preferences

## How To Install & Use

* Download the zip at [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/blade-and-sorcery/m/katwalk-sdk-integration) and unzip the folder into `Blade & Sorcery\BladeAndSorcery_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods` or directly install it using the in-game mod manager.
* Start the KatWalk Gateway
* **Turn the Walk- and Run-Source to None in the Gateway for B&S**, since the Gateway directly communicates with the game. There is no need to simulate the Joystick anymore and it could lead to unintended behavior.
* Start the game

## Modification values

soon

## Known issues

* Backwards walking is not working like with the Joystick emulation (seems like the SDK dont support it right now)

## Credits & Libs

* Official KatWalk SDK
